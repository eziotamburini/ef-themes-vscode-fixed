Welcome to a refined and polished collection of Emacs-inspired themes, carefully adapted for Visual Studio Code. This repository contains a fixed, curated version of the [ef-themes-vscode](https://github.com/anhsirk0/ef-themes-vscode) collection. ✨

All original themes are credited to [anhsirk0](https://github.com/anhsirk0) and the creator of the [ef-themes for Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes/). This version enhances the original set by fixing inconsistencies, ensuring modern formatting, and adding several themes that were missing from the original port. 🎯🎨
