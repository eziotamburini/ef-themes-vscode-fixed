# Ef-Themes for VSCode Fixed

This repository contains a curated and standardized version of the [ef-themes-vscode](https://github.com/anhsirk0/ef-themes-vscode) collection. It also adds missing themes.

All original themes are credited to [anhsirk0](https://github.com/anhsirk0) and the original author of the [ef-themes for Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes/). This version reorganizes and enhances the themes to provide a consistent structure and modern format for personal and community use.
